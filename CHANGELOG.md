### Added

- AGENTS.md
- Validate quarter-hourly training data and report field-level missingness without altering raw measurements.
- Add persisted scaffold and weekly seasonal baselines, with the weekly model selected by default.
- Add forecast-only rolling evaluation with summary, per-lead, and forecast-versus-actual outputs saved beside the model by default.
- Add a target-agnostic, leakage-safe time-series feature builder that rejects the target from explicit known-future inputs.
